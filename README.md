# Elster

*Ein Discord-Bot.*

Elster is a Discord made with user friendliness in mind.
It's a work in progress made by a beginner in C#.

This project is heavily inspired by [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/) (As I used to be part of the community and contribute), but it is in no way meant to be a replacement.
I do not believe I'll build a community as strong as Red's one, and it's only a fun project for me to learn C# while trying to get interest from other, and create something consistent.

The main contrast with Red and Elster, is that Elster will NOT use the old command framework that was used before Discord introduced slash commands.
As such, Elster is meant to be a "more modern" solution (that's not my idea of modern, to be fair, I hate slash commands, don't get me wrong) for self-hosted bots.

If you're interested to help me, I've made a tiny Discord server for that purpose of trying to gather people interested!
Do feel free to join, and see what we could do with the bot! https://discord.gg/f8DmfQCvfe
